Personal Repo for the commitment of 100 Days of Coding

Answering the Call for Alex Kallaway

Commit:

I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days and make my progess public if applicable.

I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress. 

The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
